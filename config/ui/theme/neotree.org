#+TITLE: File trees with Neotree
#+PROPERTY: header-args :mkdirp yes :tangle ~/.emacs.d/config/ui/theme/neotree.el
This is not a feature I use very frequently. Simply because helm find
files does all the work for me. But there comes a time, when I do feel
like having a file tree like representation of all my files. 

The reason I like to use NeoTree over treemacs is because neotree
doesn't depend on projectile. I can use it anywhere. Treemacs always
needs you to have a project, which I feel is just inconvenient.

* Install and call

Neotree doesn't have customizations (To my knowledge) So I just
install it and bind it:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle ~/.emacs.d/config/ui/theme/neotree.el
  (use-package neotree)

  (global-set-key [f8] 'neotree-toggle)
#+END_SRC

I also don't need to deal with Icons as Doom Theme takes care of it
for me.
