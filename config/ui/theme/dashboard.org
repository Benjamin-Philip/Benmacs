#+TITLE: A Dashboard
#+PROPERTY: header-args :tangle "~/.emacs.d/config/ui/theme/dashboard.el" :mkdirp yes 


Ah... A really important thing to have. A dashboard to represent my
config.

Now getting started.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package dashboard
    :ensure t
    :config
    (dashboard-setup-startup-hook))

  (setq dashboard-startup-banner "~/.emacs.d/logo.txt") ;;Choose Logo

  (setq initial-buffer-choice (lambda () (get-buffer "*dashboard*")));; Open the dashboard instead of GNU windows

  (setq dashboard-center-content t)

  (setq dashboard-banner-logo-title "Welcome to Emacs")
#+END_SRC

I like to have a text logo. But you can change it into a png. You can
also change the logo title

As you can see, I haven't done much configuring to the dashboard. I find this
sort of thing rather boring. That's why I installed Doom-themes to do
all the work for me.
