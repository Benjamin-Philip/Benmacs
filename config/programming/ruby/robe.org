#+TITLE:  Ruby IDE with Robe
#+PROPERTY: header-args :mkdirp yes :tangle ~/.emacs.d/config/programming/ruby/robe.el
Recently(late 2020), I decided to write a script in ruby instead of
python because pypi was down. Here is a quick config to make a Ruby
IDE out of emacs.

* lazy load 

As usual we need to ~use-package~:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle ~/.emacs.d/config/programming/ruby/robe.el
  (use-package robe)
  (use-package rvm) ;; Load ruby virtual machine
#+END_SRC

* Quick hooks

robe (atleast in [[https://github.com/dgutov/robe][README]]) doesn't seem to to have any configuration
options. So, all I need to do is add some hooks and it will work !

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle ~/.emacs.d/config/programming/ruby/robe.el
  (add-hook 'ruby-mode-hook 'robe-mode) ;; Initialize with ruby-mode

  (eval-after-load 'company
    '(push 'company-robe company-backends));; Use robe as a possible backend

  (advice-add 'inf-ruby-console-auto :before #'rvm-activate-corresponding-ruby)
#+END_SRC

And that's all the config I thought about (or /copied/) !
