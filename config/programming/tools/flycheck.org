* What is flycheck

Flycheck is a synatax checker in GNU Emacs with support for 50 programming languages.
The reason I chose it instead of flymake is because it seems to have better 
functionality than flymake and also mostly because of personal fancy.

* Goals

The only thing as of right now I want flycheck to do is to just
work seamlessly and let me get on with programming. I might customize
it more as time passes and need arises.

* Config

So the [[https://www.flycheck.org/en/latest/user/syntax-checks.html][flycheck docs]] say that I only need to add one line,
and it will work out of the box:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp 
  (use-package flycheck)
  (add-hook 'after-init-hook #'global-flycheck-mode)
#+END_SRC


I also like a [[https://github.com/flycheck/flycheck-pos-tip][GUI popup]] along with the syntax checking:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp 
  (with-eval-after-load 'flycheck
    (use-package flycheck-pos-tip)
    (flycheck-pos-tip-mode))
#+END_SRC

And that's about it! Since, flycheck integrates very [[https://www.flycheck.org/en/latest/user/error-interaction.html][well]] with the emacs
key bindings, I have no futher configs to make.
