#+TITLE: Debugging using the Language Server Protocol
#+PROPERTY: header-args :mkdirp yes :tangle ~/.emacs.d/config/programming/tools/dap-mode.el

I had just setup some support for ~lsp-mode~. Naturally, I thought that I
should also setup support for debugging with the Language
Server. ~lsp-mode~, luckily has a sister mode called ~dap-mode~. In
this file, I will be configuring dap-mode.

* Install and Configure

Now, dap-mode doesn't offer much configuration. I have just chosen to
use the autoconfigure support is comes with.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package dap-mode)
  (setq dap-auto-configure-features '(sessions locals controls tooltip))
#+END_SRC
