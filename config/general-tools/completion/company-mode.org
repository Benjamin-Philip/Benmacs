* What is company-mode

[[https://company-mode.github.io][company-mode]] is a text completion framework for emacs
that is much newer and nicer looking than the older
[[https://github.com/auto-complete/auto-complete][autocomplete]]. It is great for suggestions and completions.

* Configuiring

I like company to start by itself:


#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp 
  (add-hook 'after-init-hook 'global-company-mode)
#+END_SRC

I also like to have immediate suggestions:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp 
  (setq company-idle-delay 0)
#+END_SRC


* Documentation pop-ups

Documentation pop-ups is a very useful thing to have. Use it as well:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp 
  (use-package company-quickhelp)
  (company-quickhelp-mode)
#+END_SRC
