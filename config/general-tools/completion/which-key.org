#+TITLE: Remeber your Keychords with which key
#+PROPERTY: header-args :mkdirp yes :tangle ~/.emacs.d/config/general-tools/completion/which-key.el

I think I should tell the truth.. It's not Remeber, but be reminded
what are the possiblities, when you are halfway a keychord. I plan to
use [[https://github.com/justbur/emacs-which-key][which key]] with [[https://github.com/abo-abo/hydra][hydra]]. I think it will end up in disaster. But
we'll see.


* Lazy Load

We now must Lazy Load everything (Though now that I think about it,
Lazy-Loading has no effect):

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp 
  (use-package which-key)
#+END_SRC

* Configuration

Here is the which-key configuration :

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp 
  (which-key-setup-minibuffer) ;; use minibuffer with built in config
  (which-key-mode)
#+END_SRC

That's it. I don't really need to change the which key configuration
much, as I like it as it is. (Also, which-key isn't the most
interesting thing to procastinate on.)
