#+TITLE: Manage lot's of silly parathese (lisp) with smartparens.
#+PROPERTY: header-args :mkdirp yes :tangle ~/.emacs.d/config/general-tools/completion/smartparens.el
Lisp (and other languages) have a lot of brackets. Languages like LaTeX
have a lot of different kind of pairs like "$"s and "\(..\)" and "\[..\]" 
I like to manage all these diffrent pairs with smartparens.

* use package

Use the package and it's default config.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp 
  (use-package smartparens)
  (require 'smartparens-config)
#+END_SRC

* Use the package in various modes

We now need to start smartparens in all the modes we need it in (which is all the modes):

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp 
  (smartparens-global-mode)
#+END_SRC

I like to have smartparens every where.

** Related: Matching Paratheses

I like to have emacs show the pairs. Here's the config for that:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp 
  (show-paren-mode 1)
#+END_SRC
