Magit is the popular tool to interact with git.  Version control is
something I really depend on.  especcially git (I am forever in debt to
you, Linus Torvalds. Linux has changed my life and so has git!)  Hell,
I use version control for my emacs config (An emacs config is a part of
a dev by the way. Stripping a dev of emacs is like amputating his right
hand! You see how much I trust git!)

* use package

It turns out that I don't configure magit a lot - yet.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp 
  (use-package magit)
